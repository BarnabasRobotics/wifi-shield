WIFI Shield for Barnabas-Bot and Arduino Uno
#First Schematic and basic board layout
We have added the first version of the barnabas bot Wi-Fi shield. This is version 1.0 with 4 DC motors max, and the NodeMCU Wi-Fi development board. There is no routing yet.  
#NodeMCU
Some information on NodeMCU 1.0 found here: https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-devkit-v1.0
We have an EAGLE library for NodeMCU if you need to use it. This was developed by NodeMCU and it is also on their NodeMCU devkit v1.0 repository.
